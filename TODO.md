# The Cobblemon Initiative — Implementation TODO

Living checklist for everything still outstanding before **1.0.0**. Edit freely and tick
items off (`- [x]`). Claude references this file to know what's left; when an item is
done, Claude removes it **and** any release-removal it unblocks.

**Legend:** 🧱 = you (in-world / map authoring) · 💻 = Claude (code/data) · 🔍 = verify in-game

**Already landed** (not tracked here): level caps, Memory Fragments + re-reader, Dark Urge
whispers, Wheat War economy core (P3), villain recognition dialogue, quest-tracker HUD,
field-mark dev tool, the **per-badge CobbleDollars shop** (`scripts/generate_shop_tiers` →
`cobbledollars_tiers/*.json`, `ShopTierManager`, `/cobblemon-initiative shop <tier>`, wired into all
10 gym leaders + DJ, seeded `badge_0` at install), the **bank re-theme** (`nether_star` 25k backing
+ `hay_block`/`wheat` commons), and the docs set (the GitHub wiki, the `publish-wiki` dev command,
and the slimmed README + UPM 2 disclaimer). See `GIT_COMMIT_MSG` / `docs/LORE_BIBLE.md` / the wiki.

## Gym gimmicks + cutscene rig (design program, in progress)

Per-gym signature mechanics (feasibility all verified against the real engine — see the
design workflows). Guardrails: never gate a badge behind a death-prone bonus; soft/telegraphed
ramps; opt-in forced movement/camera.

- [x] 💻 **Cutscene rig — reusable `cutscene/` subsystem (alpha.9, runtime-verified: demo plays).**
      Data-driven JSON scenes (`cutscenes/<id>.json`), `/cutscene play|stop|list` + `/cutscene-skip`.
      Body-double now renders the PLAYER's skin (alpha.10): player_double.npc.snbt preset +
      a deferred /data SkinData patch keyed on the player UUID (found by tag one tick after
      import_new; ~40-tick give-up → Steve). 🔍 verify the double appears + skin pop-in is brief.
- [x] 💻 **Cutscene authoring + story scenes (alpha.11):** scenes load from
      `config/cobblemon-initiative/cutscenes/` first (edit + `/cutscene reload` = no rebuild);
      `/cutscene record add|undo|clear|status|save <id>` captures a flown camera path as a
      playable scene. FOUR scenes shipped: `opening` (first-join Sango flyover via AutoInstall),
      `rift_intro` (Ryujin dragon reveal, summon-first so skips are safe), `blossom_reveal` +
      `victini_reveal` (wired into the transform functions). 🔍 verify each + record round-trip.
      REMAINING scene wishlist (record in-game with the new tool): HQ raid entry / Acting CEO DJ,
      Board of Directors clearout, THE FOUNDER MIRROR REVEAL (use doublePreset — the player-skin
      double IS the Founder), Royal League entrance, noble arrivals, badge-milestone stingers.
- [x] 💻 **Leader challenge intros (alpha.11):** every gym leader's Challenge button now plays the
      shared facing-relative `leader_intro` scene and STAGES THE CHALLENGER BACK 7 blocks before
      the battle opens (battle.intro_scene → compiler-emitted gym/engage_<trainer> functions, 23
      targets incl. weakened + mirror variants; skip still engages). 🔍 verify at one leader:
      scene plays at any approach angle, stage-back lands on arena floor (flat-arena assumption —
      no ground probe), battle opens from the staged spot, weakened/mirror variants route right.
- [x] 💻 **Map Frontiers no-relog (alpha.10):** build_mrpack + dev_sync bake install.json's 58
      zones into the bundled world's mapfrontiers/frontiers.dat (validated field-identical to a
      live bridge file); install run skips creation when frontiers exist (reflective count) so
      nothing duplicates. 🔍 fresh pack: zones visible on very first join, install chat says
      "already present (pre-baked)".
- [x] 💻 **Bug (Cicada) floating leader (alpha.10):** `float: true` compiler field (root
      NoGravity + EntityAttribute, post-world-merge), gym/cicada_lift (import-then-tp to y173
      perch) + gym/cicada_float tick (glide to y139 hover when a challenger is within 14 of the
      floor, rise when empty). 🔍 verify: lifts on chunk load, descends to click range, battle
      opens, rises after.
- [x] 💻 **GEN_9_MULTI 2v1 emitter (alpha.10):** battle.trainer_2/partner/defeat_tag_2/
      trainer_2_body_tag → `tbcs battle GEN_9_MULTI @s rctmod:<partner> vs rctmod:<a> rctmod:<b>`
      (exactly 2 per side — the player gets an AI partner), both defeat tags in onwin, multi
      token-shift handled, guards + schema + smoke tests. ⚠ runtime-verify winners token order
      (@1=player on win) before shipping the finale.
- [x] 💻 **ALL PER-GYM GIMMICKS BUILT (alpha.11)** — every gym now has its signature mechanic:
      Bug=floating Cicada (perch y173→y139 glide); Grass=vine walls drop per warden (leaf-filtered
      fills, hz_wall_1..4 + hz_walls_check); Fairy=Mirror Match (declare your lead → 5 illusion
      variant teams, weakened fight stays canonical); Fighting=Gauntlet (Marshal Osei + 2v1
      GEN_9_MULTI finale: Ken+Striker vs player+Sparring Second Rocky); Ground=6 click-to-poof
      mirages (ci_mirage, ambient/tick sweep); Water=Tide Clock (4-min high/low, 4 rain-variant
      teams); Electric=Stadium tease only (battle NOT gated until the Stadium ships); Ice=Whiteout
      Approach (3 PASSIVE-sight Frost Sentinels, seen=debuff, unseen=Boreas respect line);
      Dragon=THE RIFT (overworld Ender Dragon via noble/RiftDragonManager — /riftdragon,
      crystal-heal loop, dragon_slain gates the leader); Fire=Banked Coals (heat bossbar, wardens
      vent -30, heat≥60 forces full Vulcan). Compile: 229 chars → 233 presets, 0 errors.
- [ ] 🧱 **Gimmick coordinate pass (showrunner)** — grab THE WAND: `/cobblemon-initiative
      gym-mark wand` (alpha.11). Its item name always shows what you are marking; right-click a
      block once to preview, the SAME block again to confirm; it renames itself to the next of
      the 33 slots automatically (incl. the 10 stage_<gym> LEADER STAGE SPOTS — stand where the
      challenger should open the battle, facing the leader; lands in battle.stage_pos and
      overrides the generic 7-back stage). Boxes (vine walls / whiteout corridor / heat box) take two
      confirmed corners; right-click AIR to mark your own feet (fly up for the rift origin +
      crystal spots); sneak+click skips/cycles. `gym-mark list` shows progress; when done run
      `gym-mark export` and hand back {world}/data/gym_marks.json (or the log block) — Claude
      integrates the coords into the placeholders (gym/hz_wall_1..4, rift_dragon.json,
      nifl_whiteout, gaviota_tide, scorchspire_heat, the marshal/mirage/sentinel placements)
      and recompiles. Also report the vine-wall BLOCK IDS if the walls are not vine/leaves.
      (Typed fallback: `set <slot>` / `start <slot>` + `stop <slot>` still work.)
- [ ] 🔍 **Gimmick runtime-verify list**: MULTI finale (confirm @1=player on win before trusting
      prize/tags), rift dragon (spawn, circles fightOrigin not 0,0, crystals heal, teardown on
      logout, dragon_slain grant), Cicada lift+descend+battle, tide flip + rain teams, whiteout
      sight triggers, heat gauge + banked full-Vulcan gate, mirror declare→variant, wall drops,
      face-the-NPC camera snap (Mom walk-up, a DIALOG greeter, a pursue spotter run-down —
      confirm the snap feels right and does not fight the camera; alpha.11).
- [ ] 💻 **Stadium** (future building; will gate Cyber leader `stadium_challenged`≥5 once real) —
      wave loop + tiered loot (datapack) + ~45 lines Java: a `stadium_active` flag guarding
      NuzlockeInit's faint/whiteout (safe zones do NOT stop death — see the memory) + a
      player-chosen level lock (setAdjustLevel/party snapshot). Volt's tease line ships now.

## Noble Pokémon encounters (new subsystem, 0.5.0-alpha.6 — code-complete, build-verified)

Legends-Arceus-style encounters: Easy NPC `cobblemon_npc` body → task → body-swap to a real,
catchable wild Cobblemon. Config-driven engine in `noble/`; two `type`s — **`boss`** (combat
wear-down) and **`chase`** (friendly flee-and-tag, e.g. Mew). Shipped: 6 combat legendaries
(Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza, Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres) + 1 friendly (Mew). See
`docs/NOBLE_ENCOUNTERS.md`.

- [x] 💻 Engine: attack primitives, element themes, ambient themes, flyer mechanic, arena
      ring, stagger boss bar, phase-2 `BattleBuilder.pve` swap + capture/victory matching.
- [x] 💻 Content: 6 encounter JSONs + `cobblemon_npc` presets + advancements; `/noble` + `/noble-abort`.
- [ ] 🧱 Set each noble's arena `center`/`dimension` on the UPM map (currently `[0,0,0]` →
      falls back to the player's position at `/noble start`). Themed sites.
- [ ] 🧱 Per-noble balance pass: Phase-1 `max_health` + `staggerAtHealthFraction`, body
      `Root.Scale`, attack damage/cooldowns, Phase-2 `battleSpecies` level (catchable under the cap ladder).
- [ ] 🧱 Decide the unlock gate/trigger per noble (story-flag-gated `/noble start`, an Easy NPC
      dialog button — add `noble` to the `EasyNpcSecurityConfig` allowlist if dialog-launched — or a shrine-crystal item).
- [ ] 🔍 Runtime verify (per `docs/NOBLE_ENCOUNTERS.md`): boss-sized model, bossbar tracks
      health, native chase+melee, themed attacks telegraph+land, ring teleport-back, stagger→catchable
      battle, rewards/flag/advancement, clean teardown on abort/logout/death, no block damage.
      Confirm the Easy NPC `import_new` spawn + `Root.Scale` + `max_health` render as intended.
- [ ] 💻 (future) Pseudo-legendaries (Tyranitar/Garchomp/Dragonite/Metagross/Salamence/Hydreigon)
      — data-only once the showrunner picks the set + species presets.
- [ ] 💻 (future) More friendly/task nobles — the `chase` type is the pattern; new task types
      (hide-and-seek, fetch, riddle) add a `tick<Type>` branch, all reusing the Phase-2 catch.
- [x] 💻 **Epic-ness pass, build-order steps 1–5** (design: `docs/NOBLE_EPIC_DESIGN.md`,
      2026-07-09) — cry-gate fix + species cries everywhere; per-attack/element sound
      language + telegraph metronome + white-hot final flash; melee hit-confirm, directional
      hurt tilt, hardcore heartbeat, edge curtain, talking boss bar; rage bands (roar/nova/
      cadence/`minRageTier`-held moves); overture (fake weather/time via `NobleSkyFx`, horn);
      Phase-1 music loops + Phase-2 battle themes (`species_additions`); `Phase.STAGGERED`
      collapse cinematics (default / Moltres "rebirth" / Mew "gotcha"); `min_perfect_ivs=6`
      prizes + capture-vs-KO reward split. 20 adversarial-review findings fixed (incl.
      pre-existing: inverted whirlpool pull, undodgeable tracking impacts, 4× chase flee,
      orphanable Phase-2 legendary on save-and-quit mid-battle).
- [ ] 🔍 Runtime-verify the epic-ness pass (cries audible, rage bands, stagger scripts,
      music duck/handoff, sky restore on every exit, capture/KO reward split, Mew chase
      catchable in open field).
- [ ] 📐 **Mini-noble "Asset Recovery Program"** (design doc Part 2): two tiers (Wardens
      gyms 1-6 / Executive Assets 7-10+), deterministic IV/EV/nature/item prize strings,
      Field Surveyor gating, flee bond, Salamence roamer, Zorua chase. **Blocked on the
      §2.7 showrunner rulings** (prize levels at-cap vs cap-minus-2, site conflicts with
      roadmap 16, Articuno/Moltres roster status, Safari Zone ownership).

## 0. GAME PLAN — the road to 1.0.0 (sequenced 2026-07-02)

The critical path is **verify → author → wire → balance → ship**. Code is largely ahead
of the map now: most remaining 💻 work is blocked on 🧱 authoring or 🔍 verification,
so the phases alternate between us. Sections below (§1-2) hold the item-level detail.

### Phase 0 — Verification gate 🔍 (first session at the new location; ~1 sitting)
The whole session's code is compile-verified but not runtime-verified. One `run-client`
session, in this order (each failure comes back to Claude as a bug report):
1. Boot to menu on the real GPU (the Kotlin fix landed; this confirms it end-to-end).
2. Fresh test world → check the log for **datapack load errors** (liberation/granary/
   wheat_trader functions + macros all parse?).
3. `/cobblemon-initiative install run` → §1.C checklist top-to-bottom (HUD, fragments,
   Dark Urge, economy beats, **shop-tier GATE test**, level caps).
4. New systems: `/cobblemon-initiative shop badge_3` → granary lockstep fires (log line);
   `scoreboard players set @s fields_liberated 4` → wheat-trader hostile dialog + battle;
   `function cobblemon_initiative:liberation/free_field {field:"test_1"}` → −6 idx +
   HUD wheat line; a FARM zone with `mobsSpawn`/`activeWhen*` behaves occupied→liberated.
5. While the client is open: capture **Sodium + BSL settings** → `mrpack/overrides/`
   (§1.F) and run the **`cobbledollars give @s` smoke-test** (§1.B).

### Phase 0.4 — Round 12c follow-ups (2026-07-06, v0.5.0-alpha.1 — minor bump per showrunner)

Round 12c fixed the two systemic engine bugs (TBCS `rctmod:` registry keys; action gates
need the doubled `ConditionDataSet` key — see ENGINE_FINDINGS §2/§3) plus spawn-Y, skins,
derby retune, Lucian handoff, clinic sidebar, tower gating, and the narrative Tier-1 pass.
Left open:

- [ ] 🔍 **0.5.0-alpha.1 re-verify** — SMOKETEST R1-R11 (battles starting AT ALL is the linchpin;
  the runbook's "WIN a dialog battle" canary has never been checked in any build).
- [ ] 💻 **Narrative Tier 2/3** (showrunner call, plan in `docs/NARRATIVE_AUDIT_2026-07-06.md`):
  checkpoint → "Resident Verification Drive" front; gate the Sango square occupation;
  ungated townsfolk defaults (Dakarai/Kele/Fara/Marlow); gate `sango_lore` founder pages;
  **Ume decision** (faceless client vs branded temptation via `payout_company` — pick one);
  Takehara naming diet; `grunt_recognition` per-front variants.
- [x] 💻 **SimpleTMs balance + move economy** (2026-07-07): curated
  `mrpack/overrides/config/simpletms/main.json` (drops off, rare TR-only in-battle,
  no blank crafting, TMs finite 8-use unrepairable); 10 gym-leader signature TMs;
  Machine Counter Mika (Takehara badge-gated TMs/TRs; Torn-Label Tadashi was cut
  2026-07-07 per showrunner — Sango is savanna). Remaining polish 🧱: verify Mika's
  **placement in-world** (1904/113/2606 Takehara mart — latch spawns once, finalize
  before shipping a world) + badge-tiered ENTRIES not locked buttons; **skin dress
  pass** (defaults to Steve).
- [ ] 💻🧱 **DAYCARE CENTER** (showrunner 2026-07-07 — specced but NOT built; sub-agent
  limit hit mid-build, build tree stays clean/green). Design: talk to a Sango daycare
  keeper → deposit up to 2 party Pokémon via a party-picker screen (reuse the
  `screen/` sacrifice-selection server/client split); each boarded mon appears in the
  pen as a Pokémon-rendered stand-in (starter stand-in / `cobblemon_model` COBBLEMON_ENTITY
  route) and gains slow tick-driven XP **always clamped by the live level cap** (reuse
  `LevelCapManager`'s clamp directly — never trust the event path for self-awarded XP);
  withdraw returns them to party (PC fallback if full) with the gained levels.
  New `daycare/` package (DaycareManager 2 slots/player, custody persistence in the
  world dir per PlayerProgressManager pattern, DaycareConfig w/ ModMenu category:
  enabled/xpPerInterval/intervalTicks/pen coords/fee base+perLevel). `/cobblemon-initiative
  daycare deposit|withdraw <slot>|status` at perm 0. **Pickup fee** 100 CD + 100/level
  gained via the pay-probe (broke → they board longer). HARDCORE INVARIANT: daycare mons
  can NEVER faint/die/be lost — inert custody + XP drip; custody survives relog/crash,
  stand-ins re-spawn on SERVER_STARTED if custody non-empty. INVESTIGATE-FIRST when built:
  Cobblemon 1.7.3 party-remove-into-custody + return API, the XP-award method that our
  clamp catches, and whether stand-ins are programmatic easy_npc humanoids (RenderData
  EntityModel = species) or Cobblemon PokemonEntity set uncatchable/unbattleable.
- [ ] 🧱💻 **Hua Zhan pass** (tester notes round 4 — "a lot of work needed"): DONE in
  0.6.0-alpha.1 — **Groundskeeper Aya → Leader Blossom transform** (the a9ed3a64 body reveals
  as the gym-2 leader after all four garden wardens are beaten + a talk; Victor→Victini
  body-swap via `hua_zhan/aya_transform` + ambient/tick guard, skin single/hua_zhan_leader,
  RCT gym fight rctmod:hua_zhan_leader). Gym 2 uses the transform gate INSTEAD of the
  Takehara 1/2/4 weakening ladder (no jr/apprentice bodies; the four warden statues stay;
  Wei's pilgrimage + seals unchanged). REMAINING: recast **Mei Lin as the Hua Zhan nurse**;
  **Tau + wheat sellers deal in a custom scrip item** (renamed paper/book — sell it, accept
  ONLY it as currency); granary wheat-canon leak; Jun's master-plan line; survey wagon
  unmark; minutes approach_warn; `sq_hz_analyst` displayName rename (sync team file).
- [x] 💻 **Act-2/3 trainer casting (0.5.0-alpha.12)** — all 38 missing/empty teams
  authored + jar-validated (18 missing: grunts 3-11, 3 admins, DJ, board ×4, Founder;
  20 empty: royal_champion + elite_1-4, 5 shrine leaders, 10 cultists). Ladder-true
  (DJ ace 64, E4 78-81, Cynthia 83, Board 86-87, Founder 100×6 static shadow team).
  🔍 runtime-verify one battle per group. Follow-ups: **runtime Founder party-mirror**
  (regenerate villain_final_boss from the live party; overrides the static file) 💻;
  **{element}_shrine_cultist_3/4** — 10 ids referenced as shrine-leader prereqs with no
  team file and no NPC (author them or trim the leader prereqs) 💻; dragon_hydra_1..3 +
  24 battle_frontier ids remain uncast (frontier is its own phase).
- [ ] 🔍 **Existing-world repair** (any world created ≤ alpha.17): kill + latch-reset the six
  placement bodies (tower ×4, Old Deng, Granny Yun — commands in the runbook), then re-tag
  Deng/Yun (`deng_old`/`deng_granny`/`deng_camp`) or the homecoming walk no-ops.

### Phase 0.5 — Round 9–10 follow-ups (2026-07-04, v0.4.3-alpha.8)

**WORKFLOW CHANGE 🧱→💻:** NPCs no longer require in-world placement + UUID recording —
a `placement: {x,y,z}` field in the character JSON auto-spawns them once per world
(compiler-generated proximity latches; see ENGINE_FINDINGS §3/§4). In-world placement
is still fine (uuid wins over placement); use whichever is easier per NPC. 30 latches
already live (10 companions + 20 authored-coordinate NPCs incl. the roof agents,
Harvest Road villains, Deng camp, garden stations).

- [ ] 🧱 **Coordinates needed** (compile warns until authored; give Claude coords or
  place bodies — since 0.5.0 placing these ALSO lights their quest-tracker waypoints
  automatically on recompile, incl. the 8 currently-beamless stages: Ume/census, Tetsu/
  night pay, checkpoint tent/memo, the four board members): hz_greenhouse_docent,
  apiarist_sumi, courier_mio, field_researcher_ume, forewoman_tetsu, company_surveyor,
  doc_ledger_barrel, doc_portrait_crate, notice_post_1–3, sq_kyc_agent,
  villain_grunt_2 + villain_grunt_field_agent (checkpoint tent pair).
- [x] 🧱💻 **Gym interior casting** (0.6.0-alpha.1): all gyms now have interior cast —
  gyms 3–10 got trainer_1–4 + jr_apprentice + apprentice bodies (latch-placed around the
  leader, trainer_textures skins, dialog + weakening); Hua Zhan keeps its four warden
  statues and adds the groundskeeper→Leader Blossom transform instead of jr/apprentice.
- [ ] 💻 **Sight arming after latch spawns**: latch-spawned villains get random uuids —
  the authored `npcsight add <uuid>` registrations (route pair, checkpoint pair,
  yield officer/analyst) need a manual pass per world, or a future auto-register hook.
- [x] 💻 **Cap ladder re-space + gym retune** (round 10e, alpha.10): start cap 15
  (gates pre-gym-1 evos), ladder 15/22/30/37/44/50/56/62/68/74/80/100; leader ace =
  entry-cap **+2** (aces 17/24/32/39/46/52/58/64/70/76), roster shifted in step.
  levelcaps.json + ProgressionConfig + CLAUDE.md table + docs updated. See
  ENGINE_FINDINGS §5.
- [x] 💻 **Gyms 3–10 roster COMPLETION** (0.6.0-alpha.1): 24 missing team files
  ({town}_{trainer_3,trainer_4,jr_apprentice} × 8) authored under the cap; PLUS the
  24 _weak variants (leader/apprentice/jr, IV+EV=0) with the per-gym `<gym>_tower`
  1/2/4 weakening; PLUS all six interior bodies per gym (skins + placement + dialog);
  PLUS leader migration (authored name/skin repaint onto the placed CSV body) and the
  3 TM refinements. See GIT_COMMIT_MSG.
- [ ] 🔍 Existing-world one-time repairs (runbook §J): magikarp respawn, stale
  takehara defeat tags, `/rctmod player set series cobblemon-initiative`.
- [ ] 💻 **PRUNING PASS — after the alpha.13 smoke test** (showrunner 2026-07-05):
  once smoke results are in (so we know what's actually live), sweep the **git-tracked**
  tree for stale / unused / needs-updating — code AND files. Scope: dead classes/methods
  + unreferenced functions/commands; orphaned data (presets/dialogs/loot/trainer configs
  not referenced by any character or function); superseded approaches; docs drifted from
  code; build/config cruft. NOT the gitignored maps/cache/dist/build. This is DISCOVERY,
  broader than §2 (the pre-identified dev-tool strip) — good fit for a workflow (finders
  → verify each candidate is truly unused → report before deleting). **Candidates already
  spotted this session** (verify before cutting): `dialog-src/dialog/sq_lucian_deliveries.json`
  (stale pre-merge dup of sq_personnel_file), `sq_perf_review_guide.json` (merge file not
  wired to a character), JEI `.disabled` support in build_mrpack (shelved), `level.dat.bak`
  in the staged map, `docs/QUEST_OPTIONS_TOWNS_1-2.md` (planning doc — still current?),
  the 28 empty/missing `{}` trainer teams (future-act, NOT stale — pre-wired, leave).

### Phase 1 — Map authoring sprint 🧱 (parallelizable with Phase 2 wiring)
Author in batches; each batch unblocks Claude wiring the same day:
1. **Zones** via `zone-mapper` (draw towns/routes/shrines/HQ/frontier; FARM zones get
   their "Liberation field id"). Export → install.json. *(§1.A zones)*
2. **Wheat fields** via `field-mark` (6 set-piece) → send Claude the JSON. *(§1.A)*
3. **NPC placement waves**: wheat traders + Granary keeper (record UUID!) → archivist +
   civilians (Nalia is placed; rumor mill/propaganda use the scrubbing register) →
   villains act-by-act (grunts → management → DJ → Board/Founder). *(§1.A)*
4. **Act 1 side-quest cast** (Sango / Blossom Path / Takehara / Gym 1) — the full
   `dialog-src` layer is authored + compiled (106 chars, 0 errors); every side-quest NPC
   has a preset in `default_preset/humanoid/`. Remaining is pure placement + UUID mapping
   (record each UUID → re-run `content_compile` → `update_npc_presets`), then `npcsight add`
   for the sight NPCs (surveyor `surveyor` tag, canvasser `ci_canvasser` tag, perf-review
   sentries `takehara_sentry`, checkpoint agents `checkpoint_agent`). See
   `docs/QUEST_OPTIONS_TOWNS_1-2.md` Status for the selected list.
   - [x] **The Incomplete File / The Lane Looks After Its Own / Notice of Non-Compliance**
     finished 2026-07-03 (the 8 orphaned dialog trees + `personnel_file/*` and
     `noncompliance/*` functions); all sidequest `load`/`tick` entrypoints registered in
     the `#minecraft:load` / `#minecraft:tick` tags.
   - [x] **Off the Record** (Sango) built 2026-07-03 — `sidequest/off_record/*` stealth
     loop (obs_count + off_record_blown, auditor-sight tick), Lucian offer/debrief + Oma
     (errand 1) + Sarii (errand 2) entries; errand 3 + conclusion use the pre-authored
     auditor dialog. Clean-sweep bonus is a heal_ball + praise line (advancement deferred).
   - [x] **Out of Office** (Genji, Takehara) built 2026-07-03 — `fisherman_genji` + dialog
     (8 string → cobblemon:poke_rod + 300 CD via `sidequest/genji/*`) + opt-in 200 CD wager
     (trainer sq_genji_wager, loss_fee 200).
   - [ ] **Fair Market Value** — shelved (no spec; cut for now).
   - [ ] 🔍 **Batch smoke-tests** these side quests lean on: `givepokemonother`
     (Kele Magikarp, trades, gifts), `cobbledollars give/remove @s` inside `execute as`,
     the `can_see_player` stealth branches (surveyor/canvasser), `cobblemon:poke_rod` +
     fossil item ids, renamed `writable_book`/`paper` component shape, **the world-merge
     import** (one NPC: preset import keeps builder skin + our dialog + renames), and the
     **zone-mapper NPC overlay** rendering in a browser.
5. **Act 1 beat 2 — Harvest Road + Hua Zhan City (gym 2, the wheat reveal)** — BUILT
   2026-07-03 (11 showrunner-selected quests + both route backbones + gym ladder
   plumbing; 143 chars compile clean). Design menu: `docs/QUEST_OPTIONS_HARVEST_HUAZHAN.md`;
   placement pass: `docs/PLACEMENT_BEAT2.md` (16 import-only castings + 16 new bodies);
   test script: `docs/VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md`. Skipped by selection: Boundary
   Adjustments, the dojo, Pest Control, Bloom Festival, Two Botanies. Guidebook
   (wiki/Guidebook-Act-I.md) updated through Hua Zhan.

### Phase 2 — Wiring on authoring output 💻 (Claude; fast turnaround per batch)
- Field guards: per-field `command` rewards firing `liberation/free_field {field:"<id>"}`;
  FARM zones in install.json get `activeWhenObjective: field_freed` per field id.
- Granary UUID recorded → re-run `generate_granary_tiers` (fills `apply_<tier>` fns).
- Fold zone exports into install.json; regenerate presets/functions; `install run` cycle.

### Phase 3 — Balance + polish (joint; needs Phase 0-2 done)
- **Open balance decisions** (Claude needs answers, §1.B): field pushback −6 × ~6 fields?
  liberation swap a shop tier or stay narrative? liberation gate/soften the HQ raid?
- Tune granary pool/prices, ambush thresholds, instability tug-of-war from playtest feel.
- Optional narrative systems: Founder name de-obfuscation as the Board falls (next
  unblocked 💻 item), exchange boards, reserved farm plots; Option C (`farmzone/`) go/no-go.

### Phase 4 — Release pass (§2; mostly 💻 after authoring bakes)
- Strip dev tooling (field-mark → zone-trace → npc-map) as each authoring stream closes.
- Debug-command audit, docs/wiki sync + `publish-wiki`, version bump **1.0.0**,
  `build-mrpack --with-map`, and a clean-launcher **install test** of the final pack.

## 1. BUILD — still to land

### A. In-world authoring 🧱 (blocks the systems in §B)
- [x] **Zones** — the zone-mapper export (dev/zones.json) is baked into `install.json`: **58 zones** — 13 towns, **all 5 shrines**, **7 Battle Frontier facilities** (flavor subtitles), 19 route segments named in journey order ("Route N" subtitles; user-named "Road to Royal League"; Route 16 = "Frontier Causeway"), **10 farms gated `field_freed`/`farm_N`**, 3 landmarks, canonical HQ preserved. Array priority-sorted so nested zones (facilities/shrines) announce over their surroundings. *Optional:* route gaps 4/6/9/11 if intended. 🔍 fresh `install run`. → *unblocks removing Zone Trace (§2)*
- [ ] **Villain NPC placement** — every villain in `villain_team.json` is at `[0,0,0]`. Place each with real coords, composed from the battle + recognition-dialogue snippets:
  - [ ] 11 grunts (Field Agent → Elite Agent), gym-gated on routes
  - [ ] 3 management (Regional Manager Shade, Senior Director Vex, COO Noir)
  - [ ] Acting CEO DJ at HQ `[1590 51 1028]`
  - [ ] 4 Board members + The Founder (post-Royal-League, The Boardroom)
- [ ] **Wheat fields** — zones are DONE (10 farms in install.json, gated on `field_freed`/`farm_1`..`farm_10` — those ids are now canonical). **As shipped (2026-07-04) only `farm_1` is wired to `liberation/free_field` — `fields_liberated` maxes at 1**, so the HQ-raid gate (4), the wheat-trader escalation (2/4), the relief shop tiers (2/4), and the granary ambush (4) are all unreachable. **This is the single biggest Act-1→Act-2 blocker.** *Remaining:* place the field-guard trainers at the farms 🧱 → Claude wires each guard's reward `execute as {player} run function cobblemon_initiative:liberation/free_field {field:"farm_N"}` 💻. (Field Mark tool likely obsolete now — zones came from the zone-mapper.)
- [ ] 🧱 **Place the compiled-but-unplaced NPCs** — the dead-letter checkpoint agent (`checkpoint_agent` tag), the Per My Last Memo courier, and the Head Count census wagon: compiled presets exist for all three, but there is no UUID mapping / import line yet.
- [ ] **Wheat-trader NPCs** — place (trade→recognize→ambush) from `wheat_trader_gate` + `trade_wheat_trader` + `dialog_wheat_pitch`
- [ ] **Granary trader NPC** — Company Inc. member selling items **for wheat**. **Infrastructure landed:**
  - [x] `granary_keeper` character + 3-tier recognition dialog (default → suspicious ≥2 fields → hostile ≥4, hostile trade arms `granary_ambush_armed`); compiled via content_compile.
  - [x] Badge-tiered offers + **wheat bell curve**: `scripts/granary_tiers/master_granary.json` (+ `generate_granary_tiers`) bakes 12 tier presets (`granary_keeper_<tier>.npc.snbt`) — wheat cost = base × (1+(56−idx)×0.012), e.g. rare_candy 20→12(peak)→16 wheat. No restocks (stock baked, no reset). Item IDs validated against the Cobblemon 1.7.3 jar.
  - [x] Lockstep retier: `ShopTierManager.applyTier` also fires `function cobblemon_initiative:granary/apply_<tier>` (stubs until UUIDs recorded).
  - [ ] 🧱 Place Granary NPC(s), map UUID → `humanoid/granary_keeper` in npc_presets.json, re-run `generate_granary_tiers` (fills apply functions), `install run`
  - [x] Post-trade ambush poller + ambush battles — `granary/tick` fires the one-shot post-trade battle (`granary_ambush` L43-44); wheat traders battle directly from hostile dialog (`wheat_trader_ambush` L38-39). Trainers in villain_team.json, jar-validated.
  - [ ] Tune the item pool / prices / ambush thresholds after an in-game pass 🔍
- [ ] **Memory re-reader (Archivist) NPC** per town (`dialog_memory_rereader`)
- [ ] **Reserved farm plots** — griefing-safe plots for liberated-field safe-farm conversion
- [ ] *(Optional)* civilian NPCs: **Mom (Nalia) full arc authored + compiled** (first meeting → warming ≥4 badges → worry post-HQ → homecoming post-Founder; never learns the truth — LORE_BIBLE §2); her UUID is already mapped. Remaining: rumor mill + Company propaganda NPCs (scrubbing register lines are written and waiting in `dialog-src/registers/scrubbing.json`)
- [ ] *(Optional)* per-town exchange-board sign/lectern (economy instability display)

### B. Remaining systems 💻
- [ ] **STANDALONE: capture the CobbleDollars bank re-theme into the mod** 💻 — the
  `nether_star` 25k backing + `hay_block`/`wheat` commons re-theme (listed above as
  "already landed") exists **nowhere in the repo or the mrpack** (verified 2026-07-04:
  the `cobbledollars_tiers/*.json` resources carry only `defaultShop`; no bank file
  anywhere). It apparently lives only in the live instance's
  `config/cobbledollars/bank.json` — **lost on every fresh install, pack or standalone**.
  Export that file from the instance into `src/main/resources/cobbledollars_tiers/`
  (or a `cobbledollars_bank.json` resource) and have `ShopTierManager.applyTier` /
  `install run` seed it the same way the shop is seeded (then `cobbledollars reload`).
  Same standalone rule as the Easy NPC security.cfg patcher (see docs/ENGINE_FINDINGS §3).
- [ ] **P4 — Field liberation** (needs marked coords): guard trainers, liberate → restore wheat price + unlock safe-farm + advance HQ gate; relog-safe one-way latches; `liberation/fields.json`
  - [x] **Option A core** — `liberation/free_field`(+`_apply`): −6 `cd_instability` (floor 0, tunable) + `fields_liberated`++ + per-field `field_freed` latch + actionbar beat. *Remaining for A:* wire a field-guard `command` reward `execute as {player} run function cobblemon_initiative:liberation/free_field {field:"<id>"}` (blocked on marked field coords 🧱)
  - [x] **Option B** — conditional safe-zones: `SafeZone.activeWhenObjective`/`activeWhenHolder`/`activeWhenMin` (+ `isZoneActive` + server-aware `isInSafeZone`/`getSafeZoneAt`/`getAnnouncedZoneAt`, threaded into MobSpawnMixin + Dark Urge + zone-announce). Occupied field = hostile until its `field_freed` latch trips → then safe farmland (world-data, relog-safe). compileJava verified. Zone-mapper exposes the gate (FARM "Liberation field id" → activeWhen*). *Remaining:* set it per field when coords are marked.
  - [x] ~~Granary `sell_wheat` datapack~~ — **dropped (design confirmed):** the default economy is CobbleDollars + its built-in bank (handles wheat→CD), and wheat trading is the Easy NPC "wheat traders" (paper). No custom CD sell-back / Granary datapack.
  - [x] `wheat_war_active` flag — set by the first field liberation (`free_field_apply` adds the player tag; `quest/render` shows the wheat-fields HUD line)
  - [x] Wire `wheat_trader/load` + `wheat_trader/tick` into the function tags (+ new `liberation/load`)
  - [x] **Balance decisions (resolved 2026-07-02):** pushback stays **−6/field**; liberation **swaps tiers** — every 2 fields upgrades the active shop+granary tier to a pre-baked relief catalog (`<tier>_relief1/2`, −12 idx each; `ShopTierManager.resolveRelief` reads `fields_liberated` live; `shop refresh` fired by `free_field_apply`; gym rewards unchanged); HQ raid is **hard-gated on 4 liberated fields** (DJ's battle entry gated, "monopoly holds" refusal below it, quest HUD shows "Starve the monopoly" until 4). Thresholds (2/level, −12, gate=4) tunable 🔍.
  - [ ] *(Option C, deferred)* stateful `farmzone/` subsystem (soil/growth/patrols/HQ-difficulty)
- [ ] **P5 — Wheat traders full wiring** — _done: the trade→recognize→ambush dialogue, `minecraft:paper` currency, 2/4 thresholds, **ambush trainers** (`wheat_trader_ambush` L38-39 farm team / `granary_ambush` L43-44, in villain_team.json, species+items jar-validated), **wheat-trader hostile tier now offers the battle** ("Stand and fight" → tbcs vs wheat_trader_ambush), and the **granary post-trade poller** (`granary/tick`: hostile trade arms `granary_ambush_armed`, ~15s countdown → "Asset located. Initiating retrieval." → battle, one-shot via defeated_granary_ambush)._ Remaining: in-world placement (Easy NPC traders) 🧱 + in-game verify the tbcs battle/onwin path 🔍. (`wheat_ambush_armed` is now superseded — wheat traders battle directly from dialog; objective left declared, unused.)
- [x] ~~Smoke-test `cobbledollars add @s`~~ — **moot (2026-07-03):** CobbleDollars 2.0.0-Beta-5.1 has **no `add` subcommand at all** (jar-verified grammar: pay/query/give/remove/set/reload/leaderboard). Every `cobbledollars add` in the repo (pay_macro, granary ambush, all 143 battle-prize onwin strings) was a dead command — all replaced with `cobbledollars give <targets> <amount>` (selector-first, accepts @s under execute-as). Verify in-game that a battle prize actually lands (runbook Round 5 canary #5).
- [x] **Cast the 20 empty + author the 18 missing trainer teams (0.5.0-alpha.12)** — see
  the Phase 0.4 entry; content_compile team warnings 28 → 0. Remaining casting debt:
  shrine cultist_3/4 (10), dragon_hydra_1..3, battle_frontier (24).
- [ ] **villain_grunt_2 checkpoint dialog ladder** 💻 (minor polish): the `default` entry is dead code, and `contraband` is overshadowed at 3+ badges.
- [ ] **RCT trainer data cleanup** 💻 (from the log-0.4.1-alpha.2 review): 86 trainers log "Model validation failure" — invalid gender/ability/move entries throughout; 3 Royal League trainers hold **mega_showdown items that are not in the pack** (elite_four_lorelei `blue_orb`, champion_terry `red_orb`, title_defense_zeph `steel_memory` — those items will simply be missing in the fights); gym-9 leader `skadi_gymleader1` references invalid species `cobblemon:ninetales_alola` (regional forms are species aspects in Cobblemon) — **she may silently drop that team member on stream**.
- [x] **Founder reveal (redesigned per decision)** — the Founder's nameplate stays fully `§k`-obfuscated all run (`§kfounder`); each Board defeat fires `reveal/board_fell` (4 oblique beats that circle the name); the name is only spoken at the mirror's defeat — `reveal/founder_defeated` renders **the defeating player's own name** live via selector ("The name on the chair was always ⟨you⟩"). No name baked anywhere. *(Propaganda-decay register: done — `dialog-src/registers/scrubbing.json`.)*

### C. Verify in-game 🔍 (can't be tested without the mod loader)
- [ ] **PLAYER_TAG dialog conditions** fire correctly (re-reader, wheat-trader tiers, grunt/management recognition). Bytecode-settled 2026-07-04: Easy NPC 6.25 **ignores the Operation field** (`contains()` only), so every gate is EQUALS on a tag — "not_tag" gates ride the derived inverse tags `no_<X>`, maintained each tick by `function/dialog/band_tags.mcfunction` (auto-generated; also `no_defeated_<id>` for all 95 shipped trainers). Remaining 🔍 is the in-game confirm.
- [ ] **Quest HUD** renders (**sidebar-only** since 2026-07-04 — the top "Objective" boss bar was removed; `quest/load` runs `bossbar remove cobblemon_initiative:objective` to clear old worlds; numbers hidden; the main line advances on gym defeat; side lines ride `q.side_*` slots; `/ca quest hide` clears). See `docs/VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md` **Round 7 canaries**.
- [ ] **Memory fragment** title fires once per leader; no re-fire on relog
- [ ] **Dark Urge** whisper fires outside safe zones, silent inside
- [ ] **Economy beats**: gyms 1-7 tick `cd_instability` up; Acting CEO → "CURRENCY STABILIZED"
- [ ] **Shop-tier smoke-test (GATE)**: edit `config/cobbledollars/default_shop.json`, `/cobbledollars reload` with the shop GUI open → prices change live? If a Pokémart merchant does NOT update, it uses a **custom per-entity shop** (re-provision it to the default shop, or the swap won't reach it). Then confirm `/cobblemon-initiative shop badge_3` swaps + reloads, and a gym-leader defeat advances the tier.
- [ ] **Level caps** applied correctly (30 → 85 → 100)

### D. Per-run hardcore setup 🧱 (every fresh world — see `docs/HARDCORE_RUNBOOK.md`)
- [ ] Wipe/empty `config/cobblemon-initiative.json` `safeZones`, then `/cobblemon-initiative install run`
- [ ] Confirm hardcore flag + relog

### E. Docs & wiki 💻/🧱
- [ ] **Publish the wiki** — initialize the GitHub wiki once (create any page in the repo's *Wiki* tab), then run `publish-wiki` to push `wiki/` (it link-checks first; URL defaults to `<origin>.wiki.git`).
- [ ] After editing `wiki/` pages, re-run `publish-wiki` to keep the live wiki in sync.

### F. Zone-mapper & dev environment 💻
- [x] Zone-mapper: offline (vendored OpenLayers UMD + polygon-clipping), FARM zone type, per-zone mob-spawning control (`mobsSpawn`), priority-based overlap clipping, route→corridor buffer + retroactive width-adjust
- [x] mrpack: the 2 new resource packs default-on; BSL shader on by default (`config/iris.properties`); video maxed for the Sodium/Iris stack (graphicsMode kept Fancy — Fabulous breaks Iris)
- [~] **Sodium + BSL settings seeded** (2026-07-03), pending in-game verify 🔍: `config/sodium-options.json` sets Quality → Weather + Leaves = **Fancy**; `shaderpacks/BSL_v10.1.3.zip.txt` sets Material → Advanced Materials = **On** (`ADVANCED_MATERIALS=true`). These are best-effort schema (Sodium 0.6.13 + Reese's/Sodium-Extra key names, and the BSL define name) — confirm they take on a `run-client` session with a display, then capture the full generated files to overwrite these stubs.
- [x] **run-client fixed** — added `fabric-language-kotlin:1.13.12+kotlin.2.4.0` (Cobblemon's Kotlin runtime/adapter) to `build.gradle.kts`; it was crashing at launch with `NoClassDefFoundError: kotlin/jvm/internal/Intrinsics`. Verified headless: 69 mods + Cobblemon + **all cobblemon-initiative subsystems init**; only the software-GL window step fails in the sandbox. → 🔍 confirm full boot to menu on a real GPU
- **Known limitation: `gradle runServer` can't host the full companion stack.** Cobblemon's production jar does intermediary-name reflection (`class_2960`) that can't resolve in a mojmap dev server, and JourneyMap additionally wants its separate API jar. night-config 3.8.1 was added as a dev runtime dep (fixed one layer). Consequence: datapack runtime verification (liberation/granary functions, shop→granary lockstep) is 🔍 in-game via run-client, not headless.
- [ ] *(mod)* `mobsSpawn` per-zone flag — verify in-game a `Spawn freely` FARM/ROUTE zone actually keeps spawns while a town suppresses 🔍

---

## 2. REMOVE BEFORE 1.0.0 — dev-only tooling

**CONSOLIDATED 2026-07-11:** all surviving dev tooling now lives in ONE package
(`devtools/`) behind ONE entrypoint (`DevToolsInit`) — GymMark wand (gym-gimmick
coordinate pass), NPC Noter stick + `pos` capture + `smoke` checklist, and the whole
`/ca dev` subtree (goto/badges/grant/kit + `team`/`stage` test harness + `place` guided
placement walk). Command surface unchanged. Already deleted outright (superseded):
`zonetrace/` (browser zone-mapper won — 58 zones baked), `fieldmark/`'s field-mark half
(farm polygons canonical in install.json), and the `function/dev/npc_tour_*` datapack
tour (`dev place` replaced it). `NpcPresetRefreshManager.init()` already moved to
`InitiativeInit` (idempotent guard added), so the npcmap dev classes are freely
deletable.

### The strip (do in order; each step compiles on its own)
- [ ] **Wait-gates:** gym-mark coordinate pass exported + integrated; placement walk
  exported + integrated; smoke rounds done (the smoke checklist is the release-verify
  loop — strip LAST).
- [ ] Delete `src/main/java/.../devtools/` (all 11 classes incl. DevWandTool — the
  Producer's Tool; STRIP GATE: land + unhold the tool once first so the flight/invuln
  grant revokes) + remove the `devtools.DevToolsInit` entrypoint from
  `fabric.mod.json`; delete `mixin/DevWandInputMixin.java` + its line in
  `cobblemon-initiative.mixins.json`; drop the `fabric-message-api-v1` dep line in
  `build.gradle.kts` (only the tool's chat-note capture uses it).
- [ ] Delete the two bundled resources `data/cobblemon_initiative/devtest/
  {counter_teams,placement_plan}.json`; the `smoketest_items.json` compiler stage in
  `content_compile` can stay (harmless resource) or go.
- [ ] npcmap dev classes: delete `npcmap/{NpcMapCommand,NpcMapEntry,NpcMapStorage,
  NpcMapInit}.java` + the `npcmap.NpcMapInit` entrypoint (KEEP `NpcPresetRefreshManager`
  — shipping, already init'd from `InitiativeInit`). Remove the LEGACY npc-map replay
  block in `InstallCommand.cmdRun()` + the NPC count line in `cmdCheck()` (the
  armed-refresh block stays).
- [ ] `cutscene/CutsceneRecorder.java` + the `/cutscene record` subtree in
  `CutsceneCommands` (the rig + playback SHIP; only the recorder is dev) — once the
  scene wishlist (HQ raid, Board clearout, Founder mirror, Royal League entrance) is
  recorded.
- [ ] Keep-or-strip decision: `shrine <id> test <name>` (fairy shrine test runner in
  `CobblemonInitiativeCommands`) and the `shrine <id> path record` authoring subtree.
- [ ] Doc scrub: `wiki/Commands.md` + `wiki/Architecture-Overview.md` dev-tool sections
  (both carry "removed at 1.0.0" flags; already updated for the consolidation).
- [ ] Bump `build.gradle.kts` version → `1.0.0`.
- **NOTE:** the `fabric-events-interaction-v0` dep in build.gradle.kts STAYS — shipping
  code uses `UseBlockCallback` (InitiativeInit, LootChestManager, DocPropManager).

---

*`install/`, `mapfrontiers/`, `npcmap/NpcPresetRefreshManager` and `install.json`
(with baked vertex data) all STAY in the shipped mod.*

---

## 3. FUTURE / SHOWRUNNER DESIGN IDEAS (not on the 1.0 critical path)

- 🧱💻 **Safari Zone** (showrunner 2026-07-07, "eventually"): a gated zone with its own
  catch rules — likely candidates: entry fee + limited safari balls (CobbleDollars sink),
  special/boosted spawns inside a zone polygon (zone system + letmedespawn interplay),
  no battle damage (catch-only, safari mechanics), timer or ball-count exit. Needs a map
  location + design session; the zone/SafeZone machinery and the pay-probe give most of
  the mechanical primitives. Note Nuzlocke interaction: safari catches vs the
  first-encounter-per-area rule needs a ruling.

- [ ] 🧱💻 **Legends-style legendary boss battles** (showrunner idea 2026-07-05 — I'll
  scope this later). Pokémon Legends: Arceus "noble/frenzied" flavour: an aggressive
  **Easy NPC Cobblemon** (`easy_npc:cobblemon_npc`, COBBLEMON_ENTITY renderer, so it
  shows the actual legendary model) that ATTACKS the player in real time; on defeat it
  **spawns the real catchable/battleable legendary** (a genuine Cobblemon Pokémon) so
  the player then does a normal capture/battle. Two-phase encounter: dodge/fight the
  boss NPC → earn the actual mon.
  - Fits the 5 elemental shrine challenges (already gate legendaries) and/or standalone
    world encounters; boss NPC placed via the `placement:{x,y,z}` latch system.
  - CONFIRMED engine hooks (jar-verified — see `docs/EASY_NPC_REFERENCE.md`):
    - COBBLEMON_ENTITY render is **species-only** (no aspects/forms) — fine for most
      legendaries; a regional/form legendary needs the render-only **clone-species**
      recipe (ENGINE_FINDINGS §2, the growlithe_hisui pattern).
    - AGGRESSION EXISTS: objective `ATTACK_PLAYER` (targeting) + a melee/ranged goal
      (`MELEE_ATTACK` / `ZOMBIE_ATTACK` / `BOW_ATTACK` / `CROSSBOW_ATTACK` / `GUN_ATTACK`,
      with SpeedModifier / AttackInterval / AttackRadius) makes the boss actually chase
      and hit the player. `EntityAttribute` toggles hittability (IsAttackableByPlayers,
      IsInvulnerable, IsKnockbackResistant); `BaseAttributes` sets HP/attack/etc.
    - ON-DEFEAT SPAWN: Easy NPC HAS an **`ON_DEATH` action event** (ActionEventSet) — put
      the real-legendary spawn there (`spawnpokemon`/`pokespawn`/`givepokemon`,
      as-player/ExecAsUser per the command-lowering rules). Latch once-per-legendary
      (respawn only via admin/shrine reset).
  - STILL TO VERIFY when scoped: whether the COBBLEMON_NPC entity's AI actually issues
    melee damage as configured (attack objectives are registered for PathfinderMob — the
    cobblemon_npc is one — but confirm damage output in-world), and tune HP/attack to the
    badge-era cap. Everything else is documented in EASY_NPC_REFERENCE.md.
